# sorting_algorithms
##### Sorting algorithms project for Holberton School
*All problems are accompanied by Big-O notation files in the following format:*
###### *1. best case scenario*
###### *2. average case*
###### *3. worst case*
### Constraints

* All your files compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall * -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file


##### Note: All problems print an updated list or array each time an element is swapped
### Algorithms made:
###### - Bubble sort
###### - Insertion sort
###### - Selection sort
###### - Quick sort
